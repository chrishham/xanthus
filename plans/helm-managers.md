Excellent question. Yes, as of 2025, the landscape for managing Helm charts via a UI is quite mature. You have two main paths: dedicated Helm UIs and integrated Kubernetes admin panels.

### 1. Kubernetes Admin Panels (Most Common)

This is the most popular approach. Most modern Kubernetes dashboards have integrated Helm management, making it seamless to manage both your cluster resources and your Helm-based applications in one place.

* **Headlamp:** To answer your question directly, **yes, Headlamp has built-in support for Helm.** You can list installed charts (releases), view their status, see their underlying resources, and perform basic management tasks. It's a solid, lightweight option.
* **Lens:** Often considered the most powerful "Kubernetes IDE." Lens has excellent, first-class support for Helm. You can browse and add chart repositories, install charts with a convenient form for editing values, upgrade releases, roll back, and view manifests all from within the UI.
* **Rancher:** If you use Rancher for cluster management, its "Apps & Marketplace" feature is built entirely on Helm. It provides a very user-friendly, app-store-like experience for finding, configuring, and managing Helm charts across multiple clusters.
* **Portainer:** Another popular management UI that includes features for deploying and managing applications from Helm charts.

### 2. GitOps Platforms & Dedicated Helm UIs

This approach treats Helm releases as part of a declarative, version-controlled workflow. It's extremely popular for production environments.

* **Argo CD:** This is the de facto standard for Kubernetes GitOps. You define your applications (often as Helm charts) in a Git repository, and Argo CD's UI shows you the sync status, differences between your desired state (in Git) and the live state (in the cluster), and allows you to sync, rollback, and manage the application lifecycle. It's less of a manual "install" tool and more of a continuous deployment and management platform.
* **Kubeapps:** This is a classic example of a web UI that acts as an "app store" for your Kubernetes cluster, using Helm charts as the packages. It's designed to give users a simple catalog to launch applications from without needing deep Kubernetes knowledge.

**Conclusion:**

You can absolutely accomplish your goal with a K8s admin panel like **Headlamp**. However, for a more feature-rich interactive experience, tools like **Lens** and **Rancher** are very popular. If you're managing applications in a production environment, adopting a GitOps tool like **Argo CD** is the industry-standard best practice.
