Thanks for the image. Based on the cookie attributes shown in the screenshot, here’s a security evaluation of the `cf_token` (or any sensitive token stored this way):

### 🔍 Cookie Properties

| Property              | Value                  | Security Impact                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**            | `api.myclasses.gr`     | ✅ Scoped to subdomain (good)                       |
| **Path**              | `/`                    | ✅ Standard                                         |
| **HostOnly**          | `true`                 | ✅ Good — sent only to exact domain, not subdomains |
| **HttpOnly**          | `true`                 | ✅ Very important — JS cannot read the cookie       |
| **Secure**            | `false`                | ❌ **Insecure** — cookie can be sent over HTTP      |
| **SameSite**          | `"None"`               | ⚠️ Sent cross-site; requires `Secure:true`         |
| **Size**              | `48`                   | ✅ Fine                                             |
| **Created / Expires** | Reasonable time window | ✅ Expiry okay                                      |

### ❌ The Main Problem

```diff
- Secure: false
- SameSite: "None"
```

This **combination is dangerous**:

* `SameSite=None` allows cross-site requests to **send the cookie** (e.g. from another domain).
* But `SameSite=None` **requires** `Secure=true`, otherwise **most browsers reject or ignore** the cookie.
* Worse: if not ignored, **a man-in-the-middle (MitM)** on an HTTP connection could steal it.

---

### ✅ Recommended Fix

To store a secure authentication token (`cf_token`), you should set:

```text
HttpOnly: true
Secure: true
SameSite: Lax (or Strict if you don't need cross-site)
```

---

### 🛡️ TL;DR: Is it Safe?

* ✅ `HttpOnly: true` → protects against XSS.
* ❌ `Secure: false` → **cookie can be leaked over HTTP**, especially if users visit `http://api.myclasses.gr`.
* ⚠️ `SameSite: None` with `Secure: false` → **violates spec**, can lead to CSRF or cookie rejection.

> 🔥 **Bottom line:** Your `cf_token` is **not secure** as-is. Set `Secure: true` in production (especially with `SameSite: None`).

Let me know if you're using a particular backend (e.g. Go, Node.js, Django) — I can show you how to set it securely.
