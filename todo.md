# VPS Management

- can the status of each vps be updated automatically at a logical time interva without a page reload?

- show cost per month for vps and current accumulated cost
- is there a way to determine the degree of utilisation of the vps ? so that the user will know if he needs to provision another vps
- at vps creation state that the prices are without tax. or can we fetch and the tax here to?

- when the vpn is created, then show a loading modal with ingo about the current creation status, not just refresh the vps list

- in Hetzner security ssh keys i see this: xanthus-key-1750699924  will xanthus reuse this for every vps creation?
