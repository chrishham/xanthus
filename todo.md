# VPS Management
- when the vpn is created, then show a loading modal with info about the current creation status, not just refresh the vps list
- can the status of each vps be updated automatically at a logical time interva without a page reload?

- can we connect to vps within the browser via ssy? not implement anything from start , think about existing solutions.  

- show cost per month for vps and current accumulated cost
- is there a way to determine the degree of utilisation of the vps ? so that the user will know if he needs to provision another vps
- at vps creation state that the prices are without tax. or can we fetch and the tax here to?
