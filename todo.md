# VPS Management

- i liked the step by step vps creation more: input hetzner key, (let the user reuse its existing hetzer key if he wants to ), location selection and then list the available options which can be filtered by architecture and sorted by prize ,ram ,cpu and prize


- show cost per month for vps and current accumulated cost
- at vps creation state that the prices are without tax. or can we fetch and the tax here to?

- when the vpn is created, then show a loading modal with ingo about the current creation status, not just refresh the vps list

- in Hetzner security ssh keys i see this: xanthus-key-1750699924  will xanthus reuse this for every vps creation?

- fix the errors at output.css

- Make the token for authenticating session at xanthus web app last all day.
