### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Node.js 18+
- Make

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
make dev

make test

# Run linter
make lint

# Build for production
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Xanthus follows a clean **Handler-Service-Model (HSM)** architecture:

- **Handlers** - HTTP request processing and routing
- **Services** - Business logic and external service integration
- **Models** - Data structures and validation

### Key Components

- **Application Catalog** - YAML-based application definitions
- **VPS Management** - Multi-cloud VPS provisioning and management
- **DNS/SSL Automation** - Cloudflare integration for domain management
- **Kubernetes Integration** - K3s deployment with Helm charts
- **Version Management** - Self-updating capabilities with rollback support

- [Services Architecture](internal/services/README.md)
- [Models Architecture](internal/models/README.md)

## üöÄ Creating Releases

### For Maintainers

Create a new release using the automated release system:

```bash
# Create a new release (replace with your version)
make release VERSION=v1.0.0
```

This command will:
1. **Run tests** to ensure code quality
2. **Create a Git tag** with the specified version
3. **Push to GitHub** to trigger the automated release workflow
4. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Build multi-architecture Docker images (AMD64 + ARM64)
   - Create cross-platform binaries (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Publish to GitHub Container Registry
   - Create GitHub Release with downloadable assets

### Re-releasing (Fixing Issues)

If you need to fix issues in an existing release without bumping the version:

```bash
# Fix your issues first
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical bug in v1.0.0"

# Re-release the same version with fixes
make re-release VERSION=v1.0.0
```

The `re-release` command will:
1. **Run tests** to ensure the fixes work
2. **Force-update the existing Git tag** to point to the current commit
3. **Trigger GitHub Actions** to rebuild and replace all artifacts
4. **Update Docker images and binaries** without changing version numbers

This is perfect for:
- üêõ **Critical bug fixes**
- üîí **Security patches** 
- üìù **Documentation updates**
- üèóÔ∏è **Build improvements**

### Version Format

- **Stable releases**: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v2.0.0`
- **Pre-releases**: `v1.0.0-rc.1`, `v1.0.0-beta.1`
- **Patch releases**: `v1.0.1`, `v1.0.2`

### Release Artifacts

After a successful release, artifacts will be available at:
- **Docker Images**: `ghcr.io/chrishham/xanthus:v1.0.0`
- **Binaries**: [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/chrishham/xanthus/releases)
- **Container Registry**: Multi-architecture images automatically built

### Release Strategy

- **Development builds**: Only run CI tests, no artifacts created
- **Tagged releases**: Full build pipeline with multi-platform artifacts
- **Automated quality gates**: Tests must pass before release creation
- **Security scanning**: All Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities

### Troubleshooting Releases

**Q: Release workflow failed with "tag already exists"**
```bash
# Use re-release instead of release for existing versions
make re-release VERSION=v1.0.0
```

**Q: Docker build fails with "tailwindcss: not found"**
- This should be fixed in recent versions. If you encounter this, ensure your Dockerfile includes devDependencies during build.

**Q: How to cancel a failed release?**
```bash
# Delete the tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin --delete v1.0.0
```

**Q: Release assets are missing or incomplete**
- Check GitHub Actions workflow logs for errors
- Re-run the workflow from GitHub Actions UI, or use `make re-release`
